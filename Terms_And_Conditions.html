            <h2>Dispute Resolution</h2>
            <p>The Life@RTU platform, operated by Rizal Technological University (RTU), strives to provide a positive and collaborative online environment for its users. In the event of disputes
                 or disagreements arising from platform usage, the following dispute resolution procedures will be followed</p>
            <ol>
                <li><h3>Informal Resoltuion</h3></li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Users are encouraged to attempt an informal resolution of disputes by first communicating directly with the involved parties. This may involve discussing concerns, 
                        clarifying misunderstandings, and finding common ground to resolve the issue amicably.</li>
                </ul>
                <li><h3>Administrator Intervention</h3></li>
                <ul>
                    <li>If an informal resolution is not successful, users may escalate the matter by contacting the platform administrators. Administrators will review the dispute, gather
                        relevant information, and facilitate communication between the involved parties to find a resolution.</li>
                </ul>
                <li><h3>Mediation</h3></li>
                <ul>
                    <li>In cases where disputes persist, mediation may be considered. Mediation involves a neutral third party, often appointed by RTU, who will assist the parties in reaching a 
                        mutually acceptable resolution. The mediator does not make decisions but facilitates communication and negotiation.</li>
                </ul>
                <li><h3>Arbitration</h3></li>
                <ul>
                    <li>If informal resolution and mediation do not lead to a satisfactory outcome, arbitration may be pursued. Arbitration involves the submission of the dispute to a neutral
                        arbitrator or panel, whose decision is binding on the parties. This provides a more formalized process for dispute resolution.</li>
                </ul>
                <li><h3>Legal Action</h3></li>
                <ul>
                    <li>As a last resort, users may choose to pursue legal action to resolve disputes. This step involves taking the matter to a court of law, and users should be aware of 
                        the legal implications and costs associated with such action.</li>
                </ul>
                <li><h3>Compliance with Applicable Laws</h3></li>
                <ul>
                    <li>All dispute resolution processes will be conducted in compliance with applicable laws, including but not limited to the laws of the Philippines and international legal standards.</li>
                </ul>
                <li><h3>Reporting Violations</h3></li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Users are encouraged to report any violations of platform guidelines, harassment, or inappropriate conduct promptly to the administrators. This will aid in the timely resolution of disputes and the maintenance of a positive online environment.</li>
